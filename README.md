# Coptic texts


This is a selected corpus of hagiographic and homiletic texts, consistent and homogeneous in terms of cultural and literary milieu, period and genre. These texts are  marked-up, in order to:

  1. provide useful geographical information for the [Archaeological Atlas of Coptic Literature](http://paths.uniroma.it) (places, architectural typologies, historical characters, heresiological groups, etc.);

  1. put at disposal of other scholars a public repository of open-access annotated texts useful for any further research.

The selection has been made considering their geographical proximity, the chronological and cultural context, i.e. the monastic homogeneous environment of the so-called **Middle Egypt**. All the selected texts were already available in electronic version in the [CMCL database](http://cmcl.it).

The [XSD schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_(W3C)) used to validate all texts is also available in the repository.
